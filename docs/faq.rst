1. Arrrrr! Where are simple text configs? I don't want to learn python
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please accept my condolences. This is **scripting** extension
for NETWM window managers. You'd better pass.


2. Where I can find some python tutor?
--------------------------------------

Python is a very simple language. You can find introduction material in following
places:

* `Official tutorial <http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html>`_ You should
  reed sections 3, 4 and 5.

* `Learn Python The Hard Way <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/>`_ is
  a must-read thing for beginners.

The only part you'll find hard to understand are decorators. Yeah, these
mysterious ``@`` signs. I couldn't find basic short explanation, only
`this post <http://blog.ipnext.it/?p=242>`_.


3. Is Orcsome fast? I hear python is a slow interpreted language
----------------------------------------------------------------

Orcsome handles not so many X events and python performance is acceptable for
this task. For example Orcsome with my huge and complex config takes same amount
of processor time as bmpanel2 (small and light panel app written in "C").


4. Hey, I need functionality XXX. Where it is?
----------------------------------------------

Current Orcsome API is made for my configuration script needs.
If you need XXX â€” just :ref:`ask <contacts>`.
